  methodology_title: "Our Research Methodology"
  methodology_paragraph_1: >
    We sent more than 90 brands questionnaires to give them the opportunity to showcase the efforts they are making towards paying a living wage to all workers in their supply chain and to disclose their production locations (if they had not done so through the Transparency Pledge). Our emphasis is on expressing the brands’ efforts to pay a living wage through SMART data collected via this research in a transparent and comprehensive format for consumers, garment workers and policy makers. It is hoped that, in the long term, brands representation on Fashion Checker will become a component of a brand’s due diligence and CSR validation process.
  methodology_paragraph_2: >
    Because of the challenging context, including workers’ reluctance to speak with researchers for fear of reprisal, field research at workplace level has initially only been carried out in five countries where access to garment workers is guaranteed; Indonesia, China, Croatia, India and the Ukraine. We collected workers’ payslips,
    conducted interviews to interpret the information the payslips provide, disaggregated
    by gender (e.g. on gender pay gaps, work responsibilities, working hours,bonuses,
    overtime). We then checked these wages against the response given by brands on their
    living wage benchmarks and the percentage of suppliers paid according to this
    benchmark. We will be adding data from more countries as this project progresses.

  gender_influences: >
    Gender influences labour practices in countless ways: ideas about the jobs women can do, how they should do them, their wages, their relationship to employers and the law. Everything from the level of payment and how quickly a worker is paid, to the terms of your employment, such as lack of a contract, no medical or maternity leave, no right to organise, or no pension, down to the way a supervisor speaks to or touches a worker,is informed in part by gender-based notions of what is acceptable. Detailed factory profiles reveal that at the factory level, women workers are concentrated in subordinate roles, such as machine operator and checkers. Women are routinely employed in low skill level roles and rarely reach leadership positions in their factories or unions.

  women_face_stress: >
    Women face stress created by job insecurity, verbal and physical harassment, malnutrition from low pay, exhaustion resulting from forced overtime, and the inability to do anything about unsafe working practices and environments. Women’s rights are also violated outside the workplace. That cannot be ignored as it shapes the reality of who a woman worker is, both in and outside the workplace. Discrimination in terms of double workload (productive and reproductive), discrimination in the community and in the home, discrimination before the law (in the shape of regulations regarding property ownership, inheritance, etc.), these are all factors in creating the context in which a woman lives and works. She doesn’t shed these aspects of her reality when she enters her workplace. The roll-out effect on a woman’s health and that of her children is immediately evident.
  low_wages: "Low Wages"
  when_looking_at_the_garment_sector: >
    When looking at the garment sector, the division of work is very much gendered: The further down the supply chain you go, the more precarious the work; the lower the pay, the greater the share of women workers. Employers are able to take advantage of cultural stereotypes that depict women as passive, flexible, and less likely to challenge management. Women are typically paid less than men because their income is seen as complementary to those of male breadwinners. In reality, however, women workers often represent the sole income providers for the household. This form of inequality is most clearly observed in the difference between men’s wages and women’s wages, often referred to as the ‘gender pay gap’. Women are often paid less than men in the clothing industry, even if they do the same tasks.
  since_women_are_mainly_employed: >
    Since women are mainly employed in lower-paid and lower-power positions they are more likely to be affected by poverty. Poverty in turn increases the likelihood of becoming a victim of violence and harassment. Gender-based violence and harassment are most common in industries where women are paid low wages and have little decision-making authority. The textile industry, with the structure of its supply chains, is one of these industries that structurally encourage violence and harassment. As the majority of the workforce is female, including many young women and migrants, the majority of garment workers also do not have any power to improve their situation.They are in a relationship of dependency with mostly male superiors who are often also their abusers.
  gender_based_violence: "Gender-based Violence"
  gender_based_violence_is_both_a_cause: >
    Gender-based violence is both a cause and a consequence of poverty and gender inequality. GBV ranges from gendered discrimination, such as lack of access to maternity leave and childcare, to brutal physical violence such as rape or murder. A recent report on
  found_that_76_of_all: >
    found that 76% of all interviewed workers had faced some form of GBV at the workplace. When looking at all cases of GBV, sexual harassment is the form of violence that workers experience most often. When analyzing physical violence, slapping was the most common form of physical violence, experienced by 80% of workers. Workers report that getting slapped by supervisors is especially common when production targets are high and / or deadlines are tight. The other most common forms of violence are beating (44%), kicking (42%) and punching (11%). While domestic violence is clearly one of the most prevalent form of sexual violence against women, out of those interviewees who have experienced rape, a shocking 6% were raped by their supervisor or line chief.
  despite_its_prevalence_in_the_garment_sector: >
    Despite its prevalence in the garment sector, GBV mostly does not show up in factory audits since the format of classic audits does not involve workers to a degree that would allow them to speak about such sensitive issues. Interviews with workers often happen on-site, sometimes even in the presence of male superiors who are potential perpetrators of GBV.
  to_address_gender_based_violence_in_the_supply: >
    To address gender-based violence in the supply chain, brands need to understand and recognise their own role in the dynamics that lead to gender-based violence. Recent studies show that buyers increasingly use their leverage over suppliers to demand lower prices, shorter lead times for higher production quantities, and sudden changes to orders. As a result, suppliers increase workers production targets which lead to an increase in violence and harassment towards workers when targets are not met.
  this_is_confirmed_by_the_evidence: >
    This is confirmed by the evidence from Bangladesh: 64% of the respondents in the present study stated that they were under tremendous pressure to produce garment products and 35% of them stated that they had experienced violence from their supervisors for that reason. Other stakeholders in the industry found the same dynamics when analyzing violence and harassment in garment factories. Fair Wear Foundation states that production pressure - including price pressure and lead time pressure - is linked to violence and harassment in several ways: For example, evening overtime hours can make women workers vulnerable to sexual assault, in the factory as well as on the way home. Supervisors who are stressed by high production targets are more likely to abuse workers. Moreover, if bonuses are linked to production outputs, workers are more easily pressurized into sexual favors to supervisors in exchange for approving targets.

There is also an almost complete lack of information further down the supply chain, about sub-contractors, home-based workers, the workers who harvest and process raw materials and fabrics.

    We’re demanding that brands do better: show how you are working towards a living wage, and make that information public. We also demand that policy makers create a level playing field: at least a minimal amount of transparency should be mandatory for all brands, upon which the brands can of course improve. That is the only way that companies can do their due diligence, and in the longer run the only way they can keep the trust of consumers.

Clothing brands that are serious about ethical supply chains can and should do more. A handful of companies have begun to disclose parts of their supply chain beyond tier-1, including information about the production of raw materials. But the transparency pledge is a floor not a ceiling. To foster the conditions necessary for change in the garment industry, brands need to be collecting more data about the factories in their supply chain.

In Asia, the minimum wage can range from 21% (Bangladesh) to about 46% (China) of a living wage (research 2019). In European production countries, we see sometimes even larger gaps, from 10% (Georgia) to 40% in Hungary.

    There are a number of countries that have no legal minimum wage at all. Governments of producing countries have no incentive to raise minimum wages, fearing that higher minimum wages will lead to brands shifting their orders to countries where labour costs even less. This is the reality of the fashion industry, which means minimum wages are never raised to subsistence level (in line with rising costs for basic needs). In addition to that: workers are often not fairly or not represented at all in the minimum wage bargaining process. In most countries where garments make up a significant part of exports, minimum wages have risen only very incrementally to adjust partially for inflation. These rises often come too late and are negligible: in Bangladesh, for example, the lowest paid workers are still earning only half of what they demanded and needed since 2016.

Covid-19 has made this glaringly obvious.Brands canceled orders to preserve their own cash flow, leaving the factories in their supply chain with not only no means to cover worker’s wages, but also no means to cover all other production costs. Many factories have shut down, firing thousands of workers.

  brands_put_forward_all_kinds_of_excuses: >
    Brands put forward all kinds of excuses for not committing to a living wage: that it is the responsibility of suppliers or governments, that it is impossible to pay as it would price them out of the market, that consumers don’t want to pay more, that there is no consensus on how to calculate it, etc. But while production can be outsourced, the responsibility to respect human rights and pay a living wage remains with the brand.

  this_establishes_a_principle_of_shared_responsibil: >
    This establishes a principle of shared responsibility between the state and business, meaning governments have an obligation to protect the human right to a living wage by setting the legal minimum wage on a subsistence level, and businesses have to respect the human right to earn living wages accordingly.
  the_framework_also_clearly_states_that: >
    The framework also clearly states that the responsibility to respect human rights “exists independently of States’ abilities and/or willingness to fulfill their own human rights obligations, and does not diminish those obligations. And it exists over and above compliance with national laws and regulations protecting human rights.” In other words, in cases where governments fail to protect human rights – such as when the legal minimum wage fails to meet the minimum subsistence level (a living wage) – businesses still have an obligation to respect the human right to a living wage by remedying this state failure.
  the_workers_wages_have_been_regularly_delayed: >
    “The workers’ wages have been regularly delayed for a month or two since the beginning of 2019. We complained and they paid, but not this month. The factory director says it is because a firm didn’t pay. But we did our job.”
  a_worker_from_ukraine: "a worker from Ukraine"
  the_un_guiding_principles_establish: >
    The UN Guiding Principles establish supply chain responsibility. Any production company is responsible for all human-rights impacts across its supply chain, independent of where the human rights abuse occurs (i.e. in their own facilities, with sub-contracted factories, or with homeworkers). So while production of garments is often outsourced, the responsibility remains with each corporation and cannot be delegated and outsourced down the supply chain.
  why_do_we_talk_about_paying_factories_not_workers: "Why do we talk about paying factories not workers?"
  brands_do_not_pay_workers_directly: >
    Brands do not pay workers directly. They pay their suppliers, who then pay garment workers. A supply chain is usually broken up into 3 tiers of supplier companies. Tier 1 supplier companies are usually commissioned directly by brands for production contracts. These tier 1 companies will subcontract work to other suppliers.
  on_their_current_wages_garment_workers: >
    On their current wages, garment workers often have to make hard decisions about their health care or their children’s education. It is common for workers to faint from lack of nutrition since they often do not earn enough to feed themselves and their families adequately. The added stress of juggling bills and loans and lack of sleep from inhumane working hours has long term health consequences for millions of workers. Most will have to make a choice between buying food and paying to see a doctor.
  suppliers_are_forced_to_estimate_the_lowest: >
    Suppliers are forced to estimate the lowest possible cost of production per item to bargain with brands for production contracts.This price is supposed to be enough for factory running costs, including rent, electricity, water and maintenance, material costs,shipping, a profit margin for the factory and cover all labour costs. To compete with the other tier 1 companies, suppliers project labour costs based upon minimum wages, rather than living wages; and ten-hour days, including two hours of overtime, rather than eight-hour working days.
  my_job_is_exhausting: >
    “My job is exhausting. Every day I need to do 18 hours. Many workers cannot finish the production target from the factory, so they are fired.”

  current_purchasing_practices_reflect_the_rise_of_f: >
    Current purchasing practices reflect the rise of fast fashion. Where the norm was previously four style seasons per year, the brand Zara pioneered changing styles monthly. Most high-street brands now produce 52 ‘micro-seasons’ a year. Brands will also suddenly order twice as much of their popular items. This high turn over of product, coupled with uncertain order quantities has produced the current industry model. The uncertainty caused by buyer purchasing practices is then displaced upon workers through the use of flexible job contracts, unemployment during fluctuations in production, and downward pressure on wages.
  my_factory_doesn_t_give_me_a_pay_slip: >
    “My factory doesn’t give me a pay slip.We work hard to make this dress. We work for minimum 12 hrs which may extend to 24hrs a day during peak time.”

    Brands need to take responsibility to modify their purchasing practices to ensure their suppliers can pay their workers. We will continue to work with worker organisations and unions to ensure these changes are effective.
  unions_and_worker_committees: "Unions and Worker committees"
  workers_have_little_to_no_power_to_fight: >
    Workers have little to no power to fight for better wages. Freedom of Association (FOA) is under immense pressure and busting unions who are fighting for higher wages is anything but unusual in many garment producing countries. There has also been a remarkable increase in the number of worker committees established in the place of unions at factory level over the past couple of years. This creates the false impression that today’s workers are both organised and powerful. Brands often claim that worker committees and trade unions are essentially the same, which might only be true in a small percentage of cases.

    "Trucks are constantly leaving, all the products are sold, and there is a lot of work, but they keep saying that there is no money. My contract is only prolonged every 3 months. I have no security.”

  a_worker_in_croatia: "A worker in Croatia"
  instead_of_promoting_fair_worker_representation: >
    Instead of promoting fair worker representation at factory level, it's often more appealing to brands, suppliers and local governments to support alternative structures that give workers significantly less power. Worker committees often involve factory management, which undermines garment workers' right to organise free of involvement by their government or employer. Additionally, in some countries, like in Bangladesh, worker committees are not allowed - by law - to bargain on wages, whereas trade unions are. Ultimately this means that the price brands pay for production is protected.
  we_are_never_allowed_to_go_home: >
    “We are never allowed to go home before the target is met.”
  we_want_brands_to_do_more_to_support: >

    An estimated 60 million workers power the global garment industry, generating its billions in profit. The majority work inhumane hours and multiple jobs to make ends meet. Roughly 80% of these workers are women. This is not a coincidence. The workers earning poverty wages have little to no ability to fight for their rights which is why they remain earning so little in exploitative jobs. This is a systematic power imbalance built into the industry.

  for_decades_brands_and_retailers_have_built: >
    For decades, brands and retailers have built their profits on low prices. The global oversupply of clothing generated by fast fashion gives brands the power to push their suppliers to agree to produce clothing and footwear for the lowest prices possible. The price brands pay their suppliers is supposed to be enough to cover factory running costs, buy material for production, ship the products, pay for labour and leave a profit margin for the factory. Worker’s wages are the easiest cost to cut.
  gender_in_the_garment_industry: "Gender in the Garment Industry"
  a_lot_of_informal_work_is_done_by_women: >
    A lot of informal work is done by women, either in self employed or sub-contracted positions. Their wages are even more precarious. Gender pay gaps are still one of today’s greatest social injustices. Progress towards equal pay is gaining momentum across our global economy, but we are still witnessing dire inequality in clothing and footwear manufacturing.
  inside_factories_women_are_mainly_employed: >
    Inside factories women are mainly employed in lower-paid, lower-power positions. The gendered power imbalances within factories are deeply rooted in cultural inequalities between men and women in most garment production countries. The further down the supply chain you go, the more precarious the work; the lower the pay, the greater the share of women workers.
  transparency_in_fashion: "Transparency in Fashion"
  there_has_been_an_encouraging_increase_in_how: >
    There has been an encouraging increase in how transparent fashion brands are on where and how their clothes are produced. More and more brands are disclosing production locations and signing the Transparency Pledge. However there are still too many brands that refuse to do so, and even the most progressive brands still do not show their entire supply chain and hide their lack of progress on improving wages behind vague promises instead of verifiable, objective data.
  putting_a_spotlight_on_the_supply_chain: "Putting a spotlight on the supply chain"
  our_main_focus_is_wages_and_transparency: >
    Our main focus is wages and transparency. Checking worker’s wages is currently the only reliable way to find out if brands are paying factories in their supply chain enough to run safely and fairly. Brands systematically paying too little for production forces factories to make difficult choices. If a factory isn’t paid enough it will cut worker wages to cover other expenses first. Wages and worker safety are the lowest priorities because there will always be people in need of the job.
  brands_are_obligated_by_the: "Brands are obligated by the"
  to_run_their_business_responsibly: >
    to run their business responsibly. Earning a wage you can live comfortably on in a 48 hour working week is a fundamental human right. This means that brands should be able to prove that their suppliers are paid enough to pay their workers. Most brands do not even measure how much the workers in their supply chain would need to be paid in order to earn a decent living. Governments purposefully keep minimum wages low to encourage foreign brands to produce in their country. And suppliers purposefully outsource to less formal workers to pay as little as possible for production.
  what_are_they_hiding_no_brand: >
    What are they hiding? No brand publishes clear information on how much the workers make, or even on how they can concretely ensure that their suppliers can pay workers a living wage. There is also an almost complete lack of information further down the supply chain. Sub-contractors, home-based workers, the workers who harvest and process raw materials and fabrics are completely in the dark.
  poverty_pay_isn_t_sustainable: "Poverty pay isn’t sustainable"
  it_is_well_known_that_the_garment_industry: >
    It is well known that the garment industry is one of the largest carbon polluters on the planet, and one of the greatest producers of waste, including toxic chemicals that permeate the environment and worker communities. Today’s fashion promises to be sustainable, conscious, fair and green, but without any transparency and without livable wages.
  paying_poverty_wages_directly_affects: >
    Paying poverty wages directly affects the sustainability and resilience of whole economies. An organic shirt made under poverty wages is not sustainable, and should never be considered as such. System change in the fashion industry is an undeniable necessity, but first the system needs to ensure the livelihood of the millions of garment workers who are most affected by it.
  economic_impact: "Economic impact"
  a_living_wage_for_all_workers_should_be: >
    A living wage for all workers should be as much as a concern for brands as it is for labour rights activists. Several garment production countries have witnessed low wages and inequality turn into social unrest, where workers, despite repressive threats and violence, reclaimed the streets and protested in sheer desperation, causing nervous reactions from global brands that saw their smooth production process interrupted.
  an_unequal_distribution_of_income_and_wealth: >
    "An unequal distribution of income and wealth not only creates the conditions for crisis but is itself a source of political and social conflict."

  economic_sustainability_and_resilience: >
    Economic sustainability and resilience are central to all states, but also to family systems and individuals. Poverty wages specifically exacerbates the situation of women, the main care givers of society expected to perform the most unpaid labour. A living wage is the only solution for achieving equal opportunities for women and men to realize and use all of their capabilities, a prerequisite for inclusive and sustainable progress.

It’s time for this to change.
  to_do_so_we_need_transparency: >
    To do so we need transparency. We want to know where the power is in the supply chain: Where are workers paid the least? Where are workers unionised? Where are the women and migrant workers?

Consumers deserve better. It’s time to redistribute power and wealth.
